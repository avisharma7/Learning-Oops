/*
Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of object-oriented programming in C++.
 Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details.
 Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world,
 hiding the background details or implementation

 Consider a real-life example of a man driving a car.
The man only knows that pressing the accelerator will increase the speed of the car or
applying brakes will stop the car but he does not know how on pressing the accelerator the speed is actually increasing,
 he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of the accelerator, brakes, etc in the car.
  This is what abstraction is.

  DATA BINDING:
  It is a process of binding the application UI and business logic.  Any changes made in the business logic will reflect directly
  to the application UI.
