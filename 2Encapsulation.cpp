/*

process of combining data and functions into a single unit called as class.
In encapsulation data are not accessed directly, they are accessed by using functions present inside  the class.
Attributes of the class are kept private and public getter and setter methods are provided to manipulate these attributes.
Thus, encapsulation makes the concept of data hiding possible.

DATA HIDING:
A language feature to restrict access to members of an object, reducing the negative effect due to dependencies eg.( protected, private)
